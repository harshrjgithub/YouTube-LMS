# Course Visibility Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Summary
Courses created in the admin dashboard were not appearing on the student frontend because:
1. **Default Status**: New courses defaulted to `isPublished: false`
2. **Frontend Filtering**: Student API correctly filtered for published courses only
3. **Missing Toggle**: No admin interface to publish/unpublish courses
4. **Existing Data**: Existing courses in database were unpublished

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Backend Course Creation Fix**
- **File**: `server/controllers/course.controller.js`
- **Change**: Added `isPublished` field handling in `CreateCourse`
- **Default**: New courses now default to `isPublished: true`
- **Admin Control**: Admins can choose published/draft status

```javascript
// Before
const course = await Course.create({
  courseTitle,
  category,
  courseLable: level,
  courseDescription: description,
  playlistId,
  creator: null,
  // isPublished defaulted to false from schema
});

// After  
const course = await Course.create({
  courseTitle,
  category,
  courseLable: level,
  courseDescription: description,
  playlistId,
  creator: req.user?._id || null,
  isPublished: Boolean(isPublished), // Controlled by admin
});
```

### 2. **Admin Course Visibility**
- **File**: `server/controllers/course.controller.js`
- **Change**: Modified `GetAllCourses` to show unpublished courses to admins
- **Logic**: Admin requests include `includeUnpublished=true` parameter

```javascript
// Admin can see all courses (published + unpublished)
if (includeUnpublished === 'true' && req.user?.role === 'admin') {
  console.log('Admin request: Including unpublished courses');
} else {
  // Public access: only published courses
  query.isPublished = true;
}
```

### 3. **Course Publishing Toggle**
- **New Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/v1/courses/:id/toggle-published`
- **Function**: `ToggleCoursePublished` in course controller
- **Feature**: Admins can publish/unpublish courses with one click

### 4. **Enhanced Admin Interface**
- **File**: `client/src/pages/admin/courses/CourseTable.jsx`
- **Added**: Published status column
- **Added**: Publish/Unpublish toggle button
- **Added**: Visual indicators for course status

### 5. **Course Creation Form Enhancement**
- **File**: `client/src/pages/admin/courses/AddCourses.jsx`
- **Added**: Radio buttons for Published/Draft status
- **Default**: New courses default to Published

### 6. **Database Migration**
- **File**: `server/utils/migrateCourses.js`
- **Purpose**: Automatically publish existing unpublished courses
- **Runs**: On server startup to fix existing data

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Create New Course (Published)
```bash
1. Login as admin (adminlms@gmail.com / admin123)
2. Navigate to /admin/courses
3. Click "Create New Course"
4. Fill in course details:
   - Title: "Test Published Course"
   - Description: "This course should be visible"
   - Category: "Programming"
   - Level: "Beginner"
   - Status: Select "Published"
5. Click Submit
6. Verify course appears in admin table with "Published" status
7. Navigate to /courses (student view)
8. Verify course appears in student course listing
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Course created successfully
- âœ… Shows "Published" status in admin table
- âœ… Appears immediately in student course listing
- âœ… Can be enrolled in by students

### Test 2: Create New Course (Draft)
```bash
1. Login as admin
2. Create another course with same steps as Test 1
3. But select "Draft" status instead
4. Verify course appears in admin table with "Draft" status
5. Navigate to /courses (student view)
6. Verify course does NOT appear in student listing
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Course created as draft
- âœ… Shows "Draft" status in admin table
- âœ… Does NOT appear in student course listing
- âœ… Not accessible to students

### Test 3: Toggle Course Status
```bash
1. In admin course table, find a published course
2. Click the "Unpublish" button (eye-off icon)
3. Verify status changes to "Draft"
4. Verify success message appears
5. Navigate to student view - course should disappear
6. Return to admin and click "Publish" button (globe icon)
7. Verify status changes back to "Published"
8. Navigate to student view - course should reappear
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Toggle buttons work correctly
- âœ… Status updates immediately
- âœ… Student visibility changes in real-time
- âœ… Success notifications appear

### Test 4: Existing Course Migration
```bash
1. Check server startup logs for migration messages:
   "ðŸ”„ Starting course migration..."
   "ðŸ“š Found X unpublished courses"
   "âœ… Successfully published X courses"
2. Verify all existing courses now show as "Published"
3. Verify all existing courses appear in student view
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Migration runs automatically on startup
- âœ… All existing courses become published
- âœ… No data loss occurs

### Test 5: Course Detail Access Control
```bash
1. Create a draft course
2. Try to access course detail page as student: /course/{courseId}
3. Should show "Course not yet published" message
4. Publish the course via admin
5. Try accessing course detail again
6. Should now work normally
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Draft courses blocked for students
- âœ… Published courses accessible to students
- âœ… Proper error messages shown

### Test 6: Admin vs Student Course Lists
```bash
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to /admin/courses
3. Count total courses (should include drafts)
4. Logout and navigate to /courses as student
5. Count visible courses (should be fewer if drafts exist)
6. Numbers should match: Admin Total = Student Visible + Draft Count
```

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Admin sees all courses (published + draft)
- âœ… Students see only published courses
- âœ… Counts add up correctly

## API Endpoint Testing

### Create Course with Status
```bash
POST /api/v1/courses
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "courseTitle": "API Test Course",
  "description": "Testing course creation",
  "category": "programming",
  "level": "beginner",
  "isPublished": false
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Course created successfully",
  "course": {
    "_id": "...",
    "courseTitle": "API Test Course",
    "isPublished": false,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Toggle Course Status
```bash
PATCH /api/v1/courses/{courseId}/toggle-published
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "isPublished": true
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Course published successfully",
  "course": {
    "_id": "...",
    "courseTitle": "API Test Course",
    "isPublished": true
  }
}
```

### Get All Courses (Admin)
```bash
GET /api/v1/courses?includeUnpublished=true
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
```

**Expected Response:**
- Returns all courses (published + unpublished)

### Get All Courses (Public)
```bash
GET /api/v1/courses
```

**Expected Response:**
- Returns only published courses

## Database Verification

### Check Course Status in Database
```javascript
// MongoDB query to verify course status
db.courses.find({}, {courseTitle: 1, isPublished: 1})

// Should show all courses with their published status
[
  { "_id": "...", "courseTitle": "Course 1", "isPublished": true },
  { "_id": "...", "courseTitle": "Course 2", "isPublished": false },
  ...
]
```

### Verify Migration Results
```javascript
// Count published vs unpublished courses
db.courses.countDocuments({isPublished: true})   // Should be > 0
db.courses.countDocuments({isPublished: false})  // Should be 0 after migration
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Courses Still Not Visible
**Check:**
1. Server logs for migration messages
2. Database course `isPublished` field values
3. Frontend API calls include correct parameters
4. Browser cache (try hard refresh)

### Issue: Admin Can't See Unpublished Courses
**Check:**
1. Admin authentication is working
2. `includeUnpublished=true` parameter in API call
3. Admin role verification in backend

### Issue: Toggle Button Not Working
**Check:**
1. Network tab for API call errors
2. Authentication token validity
3. Course ID parameter correctness
4. Server logs for error messages
